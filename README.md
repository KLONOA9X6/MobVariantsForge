# More Mob Variants

Minecraft Forge mod for adding new variants to existing mobs. Developed for 1.19.4.

For the Fabric version, visit [this page](https://github.com/nyuppo/MobVariants).

## Installation

This mod features **persistent variant skins for all players**, as opposed to client-side reskins that can differ from person to person.

As a result, however, this means that this mod must be installed both **server-side and client-side** to work.
